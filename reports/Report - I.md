# Report I

With pleasure, we announce our first public communication with Neo community.
Slowly but surely society has been moving towards a more concrete sustainable environment, merging decentralization, union and consensus.
With this spirit, NeoResearch team is going to be in connection with state-of-art scientific knowledge and groundbreaking innovative technologies.
Our main focus is directed to improve Neo ecosystem with the development of cutting-edge and precise contributions and corrections.

We would like to highlight that we expect a more level of participation from scientists of Brazil and all around the world.
If you feel you have a good idea we can fund your scientific project.

The first round of funds given by the NeoResearch team embraced:

* Crucial contributions to the C#, which incorporated knowledge from the previous months of research;

* Suggestions and smaller corrections on Python ecosystem;

* Studies on Neo machine and corrections on standard templates;

* Project, development and launch of NeoCompiler interface;

* Integration of an online interactive deploy and contract invoke system;

* Assistance for NeoResearch team structure, governance plans, funding managements, digital-security, marketing strategies, development lines, logo, and future events.

Along this coming year, NeoResearch team will mainly focus on:

1. Establish key projects and research directions (Q1-Q2);

1. Promote marketing campaigns and expanding community (Q3).

1. Create an infrastructure for hosting, at least, one consensus node (Q3-Q4);
