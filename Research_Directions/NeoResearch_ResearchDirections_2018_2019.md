### NeoResearch Community
#### Research directions

**Period**: February, 2018 - May, 2019

For this period, NEO Foundation proved to be favorable with the NeoResearch team to redistribute a maximum amount of donation up to 45000 NEO, reserved in the public address described at [NeoResearch Governance](https://github.com/NeoResearch/governance/blob/master/README.md), as provided in the [Neo's whitepaper](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/whitepaper.html).

NeoResearch team proposes to redistribute those funds according to precisely made contributions, with which those funds can be redistributed/donated from the NeoResearch temporarily address to those who effectively contributed to the community and the Ecosystem.
In case that the funds are not redistributed, they will be returned to the Neo Foundation main wallet (Ae2d6qj91YL3LVUMkza7WQsaTYjzjHm4z1) upon their request.

#### Possible contributions

Contributions made by NeoResearch members (ideas, projects, studies and researchers) can reach any repository of the NEO Ecosystem.
In this sense, we encourage the community to contribute with [Neo-Project Core Github](https://github.com/neo-project), [NeoResearch](https://github.com/NeoResearch), [NGD](https://github.com/neo-ngd), [City Of Zion](http://cityofzion.io/), [NewEconoLabs](https://nel.group/), [AmazoNeo](https://amazoneo.la/) and [SPCC Neo](https://nspcc.ru/).
As expected, in particular, we believe that NeoResearch and Neo-Core repositories will be the ones most aligned with NeoResearch proposed research directions.

It is noteworthy that contributions should be made focusing on cutting-edge contributions and outstanding improvements to the NEO Ecosystem.

The following topics are current priorities, but contributions are not limited to them:

##### NR<sub>1</sub>: NeoCompiler Eco Improvements
  _Goal_: Bring NeoCompiler to a higher level, transforming it in a state-of-the-art platform for learning and interacting with NEO Ecosystem
 - This activity involves improvements on the NeoCompiler Eco(system), bringing more functionalities that will allow easier use and analyses;
 - Disseminate its functionalities to the Ecosystem in order to motivate other developers and groups to follow the same path;
 - Different tools that the NEO ecosystem has can be incorporated and improved in order to be used in a framework that comprises several necessary/basic components.

##### NR<sub>2</sub>: Consensus optimizations strategies
_Goal_: Assist NEO Foundation with the accomplishment of higher TPS and carving 15s in every block (or even less)
 - Move towards carving 15 seconds Block, which, could attend the expectations of developers, exchanges, investors and users;
 - Novel strategies for the achievement of much higher TPS by 2020.

##### NR<sub>3</sub>: High-performance Neo-VM
_Goal_: Move Neo-VM towards an example of an efficient and precisely designed machine
 - Use high performance hardware, such as FPGA and data flow;
 - This step will certainly provide a drastic increase of performance (in TX/s) for most contracts already deployed on the MainNet.


##### NR<sub>4</sub>: NeoResearch community engagement
_Goal_: Engage other researchers and promote awareness about the main activities conducted by NeoResearch
 - Promoting new challenging competitions that will engage those outstanding developers and motivate users;
 - Prepare the ground-base for NeoResearch to be sustainable worldwide open-source community;
 - Focus on community members engaged in promoting NeoResearch ideas and key projects;
 - Communication of NeoResearch activities in social media.
