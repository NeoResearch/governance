# Community Governance

This is the home of the [NeoResearch](https://github.com/NeoResearch) community rules.
The goal of this team is to develop cutting edge technologies involving blockchain, optimization and high-performance computing for the NEO ecosystem. Although this community is neither a private company nor any legal formal organization, we intend to use it for providing a formal structure to embrace technological projects to improve NEO platform.


Our rules are simple:

1. We are building up a council that will hold up to 5 members. All decisions will be made by the majority of these members and must be public (published in this repository).

1. Any person is free to collaborate with NeoResearch projects (with MIT license). In order to apply for scientific grants (travel/conference/research development grants), project goals must be aligned with NeoResearch and NEO teams.

1. This community is intended to provide academic support for NEO blockchain technology. Published academic papers/presentations that intend to receive funds must refer to __NeoResearch__, in order to widespread the NEO technology.

1. In case of any support from NEO as reward or bounty, the funds will initially be held by wallet AYm3cVBEbkSXwX9Dvq4YTZwFyxtXJT54hQ for distribution.

1. As soon as the council is complete (with 5 members), funds will be held in a multi-sig wallet requiring a majority of the council to unlock funding.

1. Any member of the council free to forfeit their position at any time. When this happens, an election will take place and a majority of council members must decide upon a replacement.
